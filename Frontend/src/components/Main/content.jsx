            <h2>Why Financial Literacy Matters?</h2>
            <p>Financial literacy is the foundation of financial empowerment. By gaining a better understanding of how money works and learning how to make smart financial choices, you can take control of your finances and build a secure future for yourself and your loved ones.</p>
            <br />
            <p>Financial literacy is not just about knowing how to balance a checkbook or create a budget—it's about gaining the knowledge and skills to navigate the complex world of personal finance with confidence and competence. Here's why financial literacy is crucial:</p>
            <br />
            <p>
                <strong>Empowerment:</strong> Financial literacy empowers individuals to take control of their financial lives. When you understand concepts like budgeting, saving, investing, and managing debt, you have the power to make informed decisions that align with your goals and values.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Freedom:</strong> With financial literacy comes freedom—the freedom to pursue your dreams and aspirations without being held back by financial constraints. Whether you dream of traveling the world, starting a business, or retiring early, financial literacy provides the roadmap to turn those dreams into reality.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Security:</strong> A solid understanding of personal finance is essential for building financial security. By making smart financial choices and planning for the future, you can create a safety net that protects you and your loved ones from unexpected financial hardships.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Opportunity:</strong> Financial literacy opens doors to new opportunities. Whether it's buying a home, starting a family, or pursuing higher education, having a strong foundation in financial literacy gives you the confidence to seize opportunities as they arise.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Generational Wealth:</strong> Financial literacy is about more than just your own financial well-being—it's also about setting the stage for future generations. By passing on your knowledge and values around money management, you can create a legacy of financial stability and prosperity for your children and grandchildren.

          <h2>How to Improve Financial Literacy ?</h2>
          <img className="illustration" src="https://www.chime.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/how-to-improve-your-financial-literacy.png" alt="Illustration" />
          <p>While expanding your financial literacy is an essential step in mastering your finances, it takes more than just knowledge to adopt effective money management skills. Here are some tips to help you get started. </p>
          <br />
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                <strong>Create a budget:</strong> Creating and sticking to a budget is the cornerstone of financial literacy. Start by tracking your monthly income and expenses to get a clear picture of where your money is going. Categorize your expenses, like non-negotiable bills, rent or mortgage payments, groceries, and entertainment, and compare them to your income. From there, you can find areas to reduce your spending and put more towards your savings or debts.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <strong>Start an emergency fund:</strong> An emergency fund is a financial cushion that can protect you when unexpected expenses arise. Prioritize building an emergency fund of at least three months worth of expenses. Even if you can only contribute a small amount of your income towards your fund each month, having a safety net is key to navigating financial roadblocks. Whether it’s a large medical bill, car repairs, or something else, having an emergency fund means you won’t have to take on high-interest debt when times get tough.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <strong>Tackle debt:</strong> Dealing with debt can lead to stress and overwhelm. While it can be hard to face, taking the right steps to become debt-free will open up new opportunities. Begin by organizing all your debts, including credit card balances, student loans, or personal loans.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <strong>Set savings goals:</strong> Whether you want to buy your first home, go on a vacation, or save for retirement, setting savings goals gives you a roadmap to make it happen. Make a list of specific savings goals and assign a deadline.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <strong>Learn how credit scores work:</strong> Understanding credit scores is crucial for many life milestones. Take the time to learn about the factors that impact your credit score, like payment history, credit utilization, length of credit history, types of credit, and new credit applications. Once you know how credit scores work, you can work towards building or improving your score. Maintaining smart credit habits like making on-time payments and keeping your balances low can help boost your score over time.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <strong>Consider retirement:</strong> No matter how far away you are from retirement, it’s never too early to start planning. Learn about retirement savings options like 401(k)s, IRAs, and other investment vehicles. If you go with an employer-sponsored 401(k) plan, find out if they offer matching contributions and take advantage of them. Determine how much you can contribute to retirement savings each month and add this to your budget. Starting early and saving consistently both go a long way toward setting yourself up for success.
              </p>
